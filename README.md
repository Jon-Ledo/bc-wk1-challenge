## HTML/CSS Semantics

## Description

Given pre-written HTML and CSS, refactored the code so that it has semantic meaning, and that there are no repeating/unnecessary code, as well as correcting other defunct code (like a link not working).

Removed all divs and replaced them with more meaninful tags, such as <nav> and multiple <article> tags.

There were many repeating style lines in the CSS, so I changed the selectors to give them broader targets, reducing overall code wiothout changin ghte final product.

I also reorganized some of the styles and commented in headers to clearly define what the following styles with target.
Ex. /_ GLOBAL STYLES _/ is written, so the following code represents eveyrthign thnat affects the layout generally.

/_ FONT FAMILY STYLES _/ is where my fonts are held

etc etc...
